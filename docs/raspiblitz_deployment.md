# Deployment to Raspiblitz

This guide is focused on installing Sphinx-relay on top of **_raspiblitz_**. Information about raspiblitz can be found at: https://raspiblitz.com/.

### Preparations

- Be able to connect with your node through SSH.
- Connect to **raspiblitz** as `admin`:

```sh
$ ssh admin@mynode.local
```

Use password `raspiblitz` unless you have already changed it.

### Install dependencies

sqlite3: `$ sudo apt install sqlite3`

python2 (if not present): `$ sudo apt install python2`

### Open port 3001 on Raspiblitz

**note**: This port can be whatever number you want. You can edit it in config/app.json in the `node_http_port` setting

Open up a console window with SSH. And log in as root

```sh
$ sudo su
```

Open up port 3001 on your machine and make sure it has been added to the list.

```sh
# ufw allow 3001 comment 'allow Sphinx-Chat'
# ufw status

> Status: active
>
> To                         Action      From
> --                         ------      ----
> 3001 (v6)                  ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)              # Sphinx-Chat
```

### Download

login as user bitcoin.

```sh
$ sudo su bitcoin
$ cd
```

Clone the repository from Github and install the package.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/stakwork/sphinx-relay
$ cd sphinx-relay
$ npm install
```

### Configure

Edit the "production" section of config/app.json.

```sh
$ cd
$ cd sphinx-relay/config/
$ nano app.json
```

Change the following 4 lines:

```
"macaroon_location": "/home/bitcoin/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon",
"tls_location": "/mnt/hdd/lnd/tls.cert",
"lnd_log_location": "/home/bitcoin/.lnd/logs/bitcoin/mainnet/lnd.log",
```

Save and exit:
`Ctrl + X`

`Y`

`Enter`

Edit the "production" section of config/config.json

```sh
$ nano config.json
```

Change the following line to:

```
"storage": "/home/bitcoin/sphinx.db"
```

Save and exit:
`Ctrl + X`

`Y`

`Enter`

#### If you want to use your Sphinx client within the same local network

Edit the `public_url` in config/app.json to equal your local IP

**note:** Sphinx client uses HTTP to communicate with **sphinx-relay**. Since setting up SSL on a local network is problematic (you don't have any domain names to authenticate with certificates), you have to rely on your local network security. Below is an example of how Sphinx/sphinx-relay communications look like in **tcpdump**:

```
{"success":true,"response":{"seen":false,"id":393,"chat_id":1,"uuid":"iJ8xow2hhR4AvLj8SGg3Eu","type":0,"sender":1,"amount":0,"date":"2020-09-15T20:49:36.000Z","message_content":"edNsPx6GmrXlM2jPwphOMaGPblpRxvkrYJcvuK2TEZDCTdFp3dFqKeZaWZS64vd/AlQCK9NQ754PWqwQHON1Ox3MMIb8SiD87WRlYSIWqAKy3PsipGiq99qDr/U5Cky7T+VKbAQyjGl4KtFo0ZWNJmzSykkjeaqj1xtsipHCAlcDIzE5KV1bomUh6z9/P22nxRfxXALCKQ7TANU0yAVqnoocvVrXNaFC77Q7t9G/zxbnf+fGU8gBEt9R/3AncpTvY7xd/bCe0EjTASj13/P9ZzZBb60LM+MEp4vxMpEwLkLCwREVBUYbac+gtznNOCoYb8u15zz9DwP9qZ49/xZwCw==","remote_message_content":"{\"3\":\"EUlLtTGQToo5MsUxsbyLDnC7jzrDX3vZjLxH48r2Fnqnyi1XWZyf9+PA84934KzqOtUXvmqmV8E5QlNtTXh1pYpOWVuO1yX+0by03BQOuoJaoHRWrRTIHZP2xOff8VufcNmb57M4PgXQaH38V+iFWQkQaBaKmagh74jVfg7kH+ZsqdTBYw7CnFSUKXdc6E8JYeEwIRuCMOHdDB9STyUVdVTm8WtEa2pB6Yagkcx4rsWJY/vbEkjYhSRGb8dO2DESB3KtYtO+J7Xs/Z/Djolk3iFcMb59XVKoIqBbxg+KZPK7Vrv06TtSr4OFSgiSnkyxm+r6TDxiNxVaisAXFWB9cg==\"}","status":0,"created_at":"2020-09-15T20:49:36.000Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T20:49:36.555Z","status_m
```

_Message payloads are encrypted with **sphinx cypher**, but all metadata is transmitted in cleartext._

#### If you want to connect to your Sphinx-Relay from outside of your local network

**note:** it is recommended to use SSL encryption for any communications between **Sphinx** and **sphinx-relay** outside of a trusted network. [**Docker deployment guide**](docs/docker-deployment.md) sets up SSL encryption for you automatically, you only have to obtain your domain and certificates. If you still want to set up **sphinx-relay** manually, the instructions to set up the SSL are below.

Edit the `public_url` in config/app.json to equal your public IP or fully qualified domain name

Make sure that port 3001 forwarding is properly set up.

For extra security:

```sh
$ export USE_PASSWORD=true
```

As noted in the previous section, you might want to protect communications between your Sphinx client and **sphinx-relay** with SSL.

In order to do that, obtain a domain and an SSL certificate for your **sphinx-relay** server and set up a reverse proxy with NGINX (or a more lightweight alternative).

We recommend using Let's Encrypt service to obtain a free SSL certificate and [**acme.sh**](https://acme.sh) for setting it up and renewals.

To configure NGINX as an SSL reverse proxy:

```sh
$ sudo apt install nginx

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/YOUR-DOMAIN
```

Use the following NGINX config:

```
server {
  listen 53001 ssl;

  server_name YOUR-DOMAIN;
  # Edit the above _YOUR-DOMAIN_ to your domain name

  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR-DOMAIN/fullchain.pem;
  # If you use Lets Encrypt, you should just need to change the domain.
  # Otherwise, change this to the path to full path to your domains public certificate file.

  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR-DOMAIN/privkey.pem;
  # If you use Let's Encrypt, you should just need to change the domain.
  # Otherwise, change this to the direct path to your domains private key certificate file.

  ssl_session_cache builtin:1000 shared:SSL:10m;
  # Defining option to share SSL Connection with Passed Proxy

  ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
  # Defining used protocol versions.

  ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!CAMELLIA:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
  # Defining ciphers to use.

  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
  # Enabling ciphers

  access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
  # Log Location. the Nginx User must have R/W permissions. Usually by ownership.

  location / {
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
    proxy_read_timeout 90;
  }

} # Don't leave this out! It "closes" the server block we started this file with.
```

Save and exit:
`Ctrl + X`

`Y`

`Enter`

To make the file active, we will need to link the file in the sites-available folder to a location within the sites-enabled folder. Again, change YOUR-DOMAIN here with the actual name of the file you created earlier.

```sh
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-avaialable/YOUR-DOMAIN /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/YOUR-DOMAIN.conf
```

To test your NGINX configuration:

```sh
$ nginx -t
```

To start your new NGINX SSL proxy:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Activate keysend

We need LND to run with keysend activated. First, we check if it is already enabled on your node.

Go to raspiblitz menu, or:

```sh
$ raspiblitz
```

Find menu "Services" item and activate Keysend.

### Run

Now it's time to run the software.

```sh
$ cd
$ cd sphinx-relay/config/
$ npm run prod
```

When Relay starts up, it will print a QR in the terminal. You can scan this in your app (Android or iOS) to connect!

### To make relay run continuously (also after a restart).

Before you start this part, make sure your app is connected and that you are able to send & receive messages.

Login as admin.

```sh
$ sudo su admin
```

Create a file named sphinx-relay.service

```sh
$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/sphinx-relay.service
```

Copy and paste the following text to add it to the file:

```sh
[Unit]
Description=Sphinx Relay Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=bitcoin
WorkingDirectory=/home/bitcoin/sphinx-relay/config/
ExecStart=npm run prod
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=sphinx-relay

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save and exit:
`Ctrl + X`

`Y`

`Enter`

Let's run!

```sh
$ sudo systemctl enable sphinx-relay
$ sudo systemctl start sphinx-relay
```

Check if Relay successfully started.

```sh
$ sudo systemctl status sphinx-relay
```

### To stop the program

```sh
$ sudo systemctl stop sphinx-relay
```

# To update Sphinx-Relay

### fast method:

You can pull directly from git to update your relay. If you have only changed your config files, the following should work:

- `systemctl stop sphinx-relay`
- cd into your sphinx-relay directory (`cd sphinx-relay`)
- `git stash && git checkout master && git pull && git stash pop`
- [OPTIONAL, ONLY IF A NEW NPM DEPENDENCY HAS BEEN ADDED]: `npm i`
- `systemctl start sphinx-relay`

### full reset method:

> This probably is not the most efficient way to update. But it works, so we got that going, which is nice. Feel free to optimize the process and contribute. :)

Login as `admin` and stop the program.

```sh
$ sudo systemctl stop sphinx-relay.service
```

login as user `bitcoin`.

```sh
$ sudo su bitcoin
$ cd
```

## Remove the old version

```sh
$ rm -rf sphinx-relay
```

## Download the new version

Clone the repository from Github and install the package.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/stakwork/sphinx-relay
$ cd sphinx-relay
$ npm install
```

### Configure

Edit the "production" section of config/app.json.

```sh
$ cd
$ cd sphinx-relay/config/
$ nano app.json
```

Change the following 4 lines:

```
"macaroon_location": "/home/bitcoin/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon",
"tls_location": "/mnt/hdd/lnd/tls.cert",
"lnd_log_location": "/home/bitcoin/.lnd/logs/bitcoin/mainnet/lnd.log",
"lncli_location": "/home/bitcoin/go/bin",
```

Also edit the `public_url` in config/app.json to equal your public IP or fully qualified domain name

Save and exit:
`Ctrl + X`

`Y`

`Enter`

Edit the "production" section of config/config.json

```sh
$ nano config.json
```

Change to following line to:

```
"storage": "/home/bitcoin/sphinx.db"
```

Save and exit:
`Ctrl + X`

`Y`

`Enter`

### Turn on the service.

Login as admin.

```sh
$ su admin
```

Or

```sh
$ exit
```

Turn the service on and check the status.

```sh
$ sudo systemctl enable sphinx-relay
$ sudo systemctl start sphinx-relay
```

### tail logs

`journalctl -u sphinx-relay -f`
